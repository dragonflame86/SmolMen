Quick and dirty april fools datapack for SMITHED SMP.


# Features

## Total Darkness
Blocks and entities not being touched by a light source are completely dark regardless of brightness level. Be careful of what lurks in the shadows.
 
## Teams
When you join for the first time you'll have the option to join either the red or blue team which determines your spawn location.
Each team has a designated leader which changes if they disconnect or die.

The leader has increased health, damage, and size.

## Reduced Stack Sizes
All items with a 64 stack size have been reduced to 16.

## Hiding in barrels
While holding just a barrel, you can cover yourself in order to hide from mobs.

## Beds
Normal beds have been replaced with smaller counter parts. You can craft them like so:

## Flares
Craft flares to help you light the way in the caverns!

## Mounts
Chickens and Armadillos replace horses in these dark caverns.
You can mount them by feeding them seeds and spider eyes respectively.

Armadillos will provide the rider with Resistance I.

## Weapons
### Spear
The spear is the primary melee weapon, it replaces crafted arrows.

It is enchantable with sword and durability enchantments via the anvil.

### Extended Spear
The extended spear has a farther reach and slower attack speed.
